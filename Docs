Row 1; (a-d) are the header row, used to communicate vital information about the simulation to the O.S.

	a: Whether the sim is stopped or started. Maybe provide a function is_active() that interfaces with this
	
	b-c: Do Nothing, wasted space

	d: Sim time; used by the now() function

Row 2 and on are process rows, used to communicate with processes. One exists for each process and it's location is process I.D + 1.

	e: Flags. Used to communicate with O.S. and allow for passivation. Two values exist.

		0: The default; used to signal nothing is currently happening with the process
		
		1: Indicates that the O.S. or other process wishes to communicate with the process/ awaken it from a hold. 

	f: Resource: ID of resource to be requested or released goes here.

	g: Request/ release tag: 0 means that it's requesting a resource, resource Id means that that resource is already in use and is now awaiting release.

	h: Time flag. O.S. will set flag e to 1 when it sets sim-time to this time. 0 is ignored by the O.S.
