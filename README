Functions:

initialize():
	* Starts the O.S. thread, but makes it wait for sim to start
	* O.S. creates bigmemory

resource():
	* starts the resource thread
	* Will do nothing until O.S. starts

activate():
	* starts a process thread.
	* Adds row to bigmemory
	* immediately fills out times in it's row, then stops and waits for the O.S.

simultate():
	* The O.S. starts running.

hold():
	* 
	
request():

release():



passivate():

O.S. control loop:
	Always the same:
	
	1: check bigmemory for minimum time (that isn't 0).
	2. Advance sim_time (in header) to that time.
	3. Change that min tim to 0, and set it's flag to 1, triggering the process thread.
	
	Do nothing if all times are 0.

	Doesn't sleep, because it needs to keep polling for any changes.
